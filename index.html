  <h1>Hello there, 
    I'm Lou.</h1>
  <div class="bio">
    <p>
     I'm an insurance practitioner passionate about developing and launching innovative products that make protection fun, simple, and accessible - especially
      for the underserved and unbanked. I've worked with digital platforms, government agencies, and private companies to bring insurance closer to everyday Filipinos.
      Beyond building products, I also want to educate people about the importance of insurance and how it can truly make a difference in their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not geeking about insurance, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring coffee shops or driving
      out of town just to relax and get some fresh air.     
    </p>
