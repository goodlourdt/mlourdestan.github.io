      <h1>Hello there, I'm Lou!</h1> 
    </div>
    
    <div class="center"> 
      <p>I am an insurance practitioner who thrives on creating tailored insurance solutions. My key focus is personal/retail insurance, specializing in life, health, and accident coverage. I have had the privilege of partnering with a diverse range of organizations, including private companies like GCash, Shoppee, Lazada as well as government and non-government agencies such as DTI, LGU of Makati, GoNegosyo, and GIZ.</p>

    <div class="center"> 
      <p>But you know, it is more than just about developing products and writing terms and conditions for policies! I am also passionate about sharing my insurance knowledge with those exploring the realm of insurance or contemplating a career in this ever-growing industry. Whether it is simplifying insurance terminology or understanding the complexities of different plans, I am here to help you.</p>

    <div class="center"> 
      <p>But not everything about me is work and insurance... outside the world of insurance, I am all about embracing life's pleasures! You will often find me cruising on leisurely drives, hopping between cozy cafes, and satisfying my wanderlust by immersing myself in the flavors and cultures of diverse destinations. And, of course, I am grateful to share these adventures with my amazing partner.</p>
